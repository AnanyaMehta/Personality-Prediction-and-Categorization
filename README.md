# Big Five Personality Clustering Project
<h2> Overview </h2>
<p> This project explores the application of the K-means clustering algorithm to classify individuals based on their personality traits as defined by the Big Five Personality classification system. The five factors in this model are Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism (often abbreviated as OCEAN or CANOE).  </p>

<h2>  Objectives </h2>
<ul>  
<li> Collect and preprocess data from standardized personality assessments, such as the NEO Personality Inventory. </li>
<li> Structure the data into a matrix where each row represents a participant and each column corresponds to a personality trait. </li>
<li> Apply K-means clustering to identify patterns and similarities in personality traits. </li>
<li> Determine the optimal number of clusters for meaningful classification. </li>
<li> Analyze and interpret the characteristics of each cluster to gain insights into common personality traits among individuals. </li>
</ul>
